TITLE: 

The Odin Foundation - Project Google Home

VERSION NUMBER: 

 1.0.5

DESCRIPTION: 

 A copy of the Google.com homepage in pute HTML and CSS without the implementation of JS (form submissions, DOM, etc). Responsive and build with accessibility in mind, but without WAI_ARIA implementation.

PROJECT STATUS: 

 In progress. The following part is to create the Search Results page and link it with this page

REQUIREMENTS: 

 N/A

TECHNOLOGIES USED: 

 HTML5 and CSS

WHAT I'VE LEARNED: 

 - to better implement responsiveness in the page
 - to implement HTML5 elements in order to improve accessibility
 - to use Git and GitHub to version control my files and host them online
 - to turn snapshots of websites into fully functioning HTML & CSS files

MOTIVATION: 

- I wanted to test my skills that I've accumulated so far while at the same time following the curriculum that The Odin Project offers. Task was only to make a website that looks very similar to the google.com homepage but I wanted to go beyond that and make sure it's responsive and is up to the HTML5 standard
